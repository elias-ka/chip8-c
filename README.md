# chip8-c

A CHIP-8 interpreter written in C.

## Usage
```bash
chip8 <path-to-program>
```

## Controls
The Chip8 system originally used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad. However, this interpreter maps the original keypad to modern keyboard keys as follows:
```
CHIP-8 Keypad   Keyboard
-------------   --------
   1 2 3 C      1 2 3 4
   4 5 6 D  =>  Q W E R
   7 8 9 E      A S D F
   A 0 B F      Z X C V
```

## Acknowledgments
The CHIP-8 language was originally developed by Joseph Weisbecker.
